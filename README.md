## Overview of the Analysis: Crypto-Arbitrage
A financial analysis to determine arbitrage opportunities between two exchanges for Bitcoin, specifically Bitstamp and Coinbase. First objective was to collect data results from the two exchanges for Bitcoin close prices. Next, we had to then prepare the data by splitting it to specific dates that were selected for analysis. Following after, we then graph and analyze spread differences between both exchanges to indicate if there are any arbitrage opportunities. Finally, we then finish of this notebook by creating an analysis report.
